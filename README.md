# Simple Java Swing Login Page

This repository contains a simple Java login page implemented using Swing. The login page allows users to enter their credentials (username and password) to access a secure area or service.

## Getting Started

To run the login page, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ctf5/Java-Login-Page.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).

3. Run the `LoginPage` class to launch the login page. You can do this by right-clicking on the class in your IDE and selecting "Run" or by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   java -jar target/simple-java-swing-login-page-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

4. The login page will be displayed in a new window. Enter your credentials and click the "Login" button to access the secure area or service. If the credentials are invalid, an error message will be displayed instead.

## Features and Functionality

The login page implements the following features and functionality:

1. User authentication using a database or authentication service (implemented using a mock authentication service for this demo).
2. Secure password storage techniques such as hashing and salting (implemented using the BCrypt library).
3. Proper error handling for cases such as incorrect credentials or network errors (implemented using try-catch blocks and JOptionPane dialogs).
4. Secure communication protocols such as HTTPS (not implemented in this demo).
5. Proper session management techniques (implemented using a mock session management mechanism for this demo).
6. Proper access control mechanisms based on user roles or permissions (not implemented in this demo).
7. Secure coding practices such as input validation, parameterized queries, and avoiding hardcoded secrets (implemented using best practices and libraries).
8. Thorough testing for security vulnerabilities and usability issues before deploying to production (not implemented in this demo).
9. Continuous monitoring for security issues and suspicious activity (not implemented in this demo).
